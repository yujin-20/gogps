goGPS is a software package designed to improve the positioning accuracy of low-cost (single-frequency) GPS devices by RTK technique and with the aid of a DTM. Currently it requires raw data (observations) at 1 Hz in input.

goGPS development started in 2007 at the Geomatics Laboratory of Politecnico di Milano, Como campus (Italy), under the supervision of Dr. Mirko Reguzzoni, as a Master thesis project (Dominioni, Teruzzi). It was then continued during two other Master theses (Colla; Palmulli, Tettamanti) and one Ph.D. thesis (Realini).

goGPS code (MATLAB) was first published as open source software in August 2009. Its development is now carried out by various teams in Italy and Japan.

goGPS development is currently supported by the GNSS network services offered by GPSLombardia (Italy) and JENOBA (Japan).

goGPS java adaptation is currently supervised, reviewed and developed by Cryms.
